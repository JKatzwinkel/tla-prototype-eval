			<p>The database contains a ever increasing number of texts, organised in smaller and larger corpora that have been defined according to various principles (chronological, topographical, with regard to form, content or social sphere). One ultimate goal of the project is to provide representative corpora of texts from all periods, areas and fields of Egyptian textual production. Originally the database was developed for lexicographical research and priority was given to encoding texts not available in the <i>Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache</i>. Since then, many well known texts have been introduced as well, making the text database a powerful tool for numerous other types of research. Currently the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> contains texts written in hieroglyphs, hieratic and demotic script, in the future texts in coptic script will also be added. <span class="text-to-be-revised">In its version of October 2019 it comprises about <span class="text-to-be-revised">........</span> text words</span>.</p>
			<p>The following groups of hieroglyphic and hieratic texts are included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Texts from the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period (tomb inscriptions, specifically those of more recent publications of tombs in Giza, Saqqara, Akhmim, and Deir el-Gebrawi; rock inscriptions; records and notes)</li>
				<li>Pyramid texts from the Old Kingdom</li>
				<li>Texts from Old Kingdom archives: The Abu Sir Papyri</li>
				<li>Biographical texts from the Old Kingdom</li>
				<li>Letters and Letters to the Dead from the Old Kingdom up to the Third Intermediate Period</li>

				<li>Books from the private cult of the dead / late "mortuary liturgies"</li>
				<li>Books from temple libraries from the ptolemaic and roman times</li>
				<li>Texts from temples from the ptolemaic and roman times (Dendara, Edfu, Esna, Kom Ombo, small temples in Thebes and Nubia)</li>
				<li>Stelae from the Egyptian collection in Tübingen</li>

			<p>The database will be continuously augmented in the years to come. Work in Berlin focuses on historical, biographical, funerary and documentary texts from the 1st Millenium BC in hieroglyphic and hieratic script. Work in Leipzig concentrates on scientific literature (medical, magical, divinatory, astronomical, mathematical, geographical, biological, lexicographical).</p>
			<p>We thank all external cooperation partners who have been and are willing to provide additional material to the listed corpora and beyond, and we welcome new partners who would like to contribute their material.</p>
