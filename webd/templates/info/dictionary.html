			<p>Welcome to the dictionary of the ancient Egyptian language (ca. 3000 BC – ca. 1400 AD). Traditionally Egyptian vocabulary is represented by three dictionaries (hieroglyphic-hieratic, demotic, coptic), which are not based on different phases of the language but on the writing system used. The major aim of our project is to overcome this linguistically unsatisfactory situation and to enable a synchronic and diachronic perspective on the words, their meanings and their uses in context.</p>
			<p>A list of all words of the Egyptian language forms the core of the dictionary. Currently, the TLA provides two word lists, based upon the word lists of the previous project “Altägyptisches Wörterbuch” and still differentiated by the type of script used: one list with words that are written in Hieroglyphs or in Hieratic, and another list with words that are written in Demotic. A third list with words written in Coptic, including the many Greeks loanwords, is ready for use but is still being augmented with dialect information. It is currently available here <span class="text-to-be-revised">[LINK]</span> and will be added to this homepage in the near future.</p>
			<p>The Hieroglyphic-Hieratic word list contains <span class="text-to-be-revised">[ZAHL NACHTRAGEN]</span> entries, the Demotic word list <span class="text-to-be-revised">[ZAHL NACHTRAGEN]</span> entries. The preliminary Coptic word list contains <span class="text-to-be-revised">[11272 ZAHL]</span> entries. The lists aim to be as complete as possible for the content words (substantives, adjectives, verbs, adverbs....) and function words (prepositions, pronouns, particles, conjunctions, ...). In addition, they are continuously augmented with <span class="text-to-be-revised">7</span> categories of proper names (personal names, royal names, divine names, place names, ...) and with <span class="text-to-be-revised">3</span> categories of words or multiple-word-units used as private, royal and divine epithets and titles.</p>
			<p>All words are provided with extensive metadata on parts of speech, meaning, root etc., most of which can be searched for. Multiple-Word-Units are additionally tagged with the individual units that can also be searched for. Basic meanings are available in German and are gradually being complemented in English and French. Adding Arabic basic meanings ist a long term goal. Transliteration in the hieroglyphic and hieratic word list is based/oriented on Old Kingdom transliterations or their reconstruction. <span class="text-to-be-revised">##HOW IS IT DONE IN THE DEMOTIC WORD LIST???##</span> Hieroglyphic writings of the lemmata follow the “Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache” wherever availabe.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Credits and Editors:</p>
			<p>The lemma list of the Hieroglyphic-Hieratic vocabulary is originally based on the digital lemma list compiled by Horst Beinlich and Friedhelm Hoffmann (usually called the “Beinlich Wordlist”, more correctly: “Beinlich-Hoffmann Wordlist”), itself largely based on the “Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache”. Later on both the Beinlich-Hoffmann Wordlist and the lemma list of the TLA developed independently from one another. Jochen Hallof generously allowed for the incorporation into the lemma list of a comprehensive set of Egyptian personal names, which he had compiled from the Slip Archive of the Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache. Additional words have been provided by the Edfu-Projekt der Göttinger Akademie der Wissenschaften based on their translation of the texts from the temple of Edfu. Every new text that is encoded into the database of the TLA can lead to the addition of further lemmata to the word list. The word list of the TLA was first edited by Ingelore Hafemann; since 2007 it is in the care of Simon Schweitzer. Marianne Eaton-Krauss translated the meanings of many of the Egyptian lemmata into English.</p>
			<p>The Demotic lemma list is built from a “Demotische Wortliste” made available by Friedhelm Hoffmann at the start of the project “Demotische Textdatenbank” of the Academy of Mainz in the year 2000 and itself initially based on Erichsen, Demotisches Glossar. As Günter Vittmann progressed in entering demotic texts into the database, he edited and developed this word list independently. It differs from the “Demotische Wortliste online”, which Friedhelm Hoffmann first put online in the year 2005. The demotic lemma list of the TLA is now edited by Simon Schweitzer.</p>
			<p>The current Coptic word list already combines two lists: Frank Feder and other collaborators have prepared within the framework of the project “Strukturen und Transformationen des Wortschatzes der ägyptischen Sprache” at the Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften a list of coptic words based on Crum, Coptic Dictionary, 1939 and on other dictionaries. The project “Database and Dictionary of Greek Loanwords in Coptic” at the Ägyptologisches Seminar, Freie Universität Berlin, provided a list of ca. 3500 Greek loanwords in Coptic. A third lemma list with emphasis on dialectal information and made available by Wolf-Peter Funk is in the process of integration.</p>
