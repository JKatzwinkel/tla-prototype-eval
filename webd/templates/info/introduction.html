			<p><span class="text-to-be-revised">dies ist eine überarbeitete und erweiterte Version der TLA Einführung/Introduction http://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/S05?d=d001&h=h001</span></p>
			<p>The <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> is a publication platform initially made available on the Internet by the Ancient Egyptian Dictionary Project (2004–2012) and since 2013 by the Project Structure and Transformation in the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Within the Thesaurus, a continuously growing digital corpus of ancient Egyptian (including Demotic and in the future also Coptic) texts is being released to the public for computer-assisted research. Lemmatization, morpho-syntactic annotation, hieroglyphic encoding and metadata of the text material allow for specific research from lexical, philological, linguistic, and historico-cultural points of view. All texts come with running translations (many in German, some in English or French) to assist particularly non-specialists and scholars of neighbouring disciplines in their work.</p>
			<p>The digital text corpus which forms the core and backbone of this information system, is the result of years of ongoing cooperation among several projects and individual researchers, and will continue developing on this basis. Contributions have been and are being made by the Ancient Egyptian Dictionary Project (until 2012) and the Project Structure and Transformation in the Vocabulary of the Egyptian Language (from 2013 unwards) at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities and at the Saxonian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Leipzig. The now finished projects Demotic Text Database Project of the Academy of Sciences and Literature Mainz (Wuerzburg branch) (until 2012), Book of the Dead Project of the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts (Bonn) (until 2012) and the DFG-financed project "Digital Heka" at Leipzig University (2006–2008) have made their text materials available on this homepage. The Leuven Online Index of Ptolemaic and Roman Hieroglyphic Texts Project of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven contributed in the years 2005–2006. With the support of the Göttinger Academy of Sciences texts from the Horus temple of the Edfu Project have been integrated in 2012. From 2015 onwards we greatfully acknowledge an increasing number of texts provided by individual researchers. The origin and concept of this Internet publication is to a large part influenced by all these cooperations.</p>
			<p>It was and still is the purpose of the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> to make available, as a kind of virtual dictionary, a new and, within Egyptology novel, tool for lexicographic research into the Egyptian language. In this sense, the project closely follows both purpose and methods of the comprehensive Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache, which Adolf Erman inaugurated at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1897 and turned into a success story. As a token of admiration for this outstanding scientist, not least in the field of Egyptian lexicography, the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> was first released for general use on 31 October 2004 – the 150th birth anniversary of Adolf Erman. Until 2014 the text corpus was updated on a yearly basis and new Egyptian texts of various genres were regularly integrated into the publication platform. <span class="text-to-be-revised">In the year 2019 a major relaunch took place, furnishing the platform with a completely new design, additional search facilities and links to other online databases.</span></p>
			<p>Functions: In its current version, the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i> allows to search for lemmata by transliteration, translation, root and bibliographic reference, also in a combined fashion and using regular expressions. For lemmata, citations (Belegstellen) within their sentence co-text may be consulted, which can be organised in varying order. Starting from the display of citation co-texts, all other words are capable of being looked up in their specific contexts.</p>
			<p>Citing from the <i>Thesaurus Linguae Aegyptiae</i>: Wherever appropriate, a citation button has been added to the webpages. Please use the citation phrase provided there together with the date of consultation. All ID-sequences are unique and permanent.</p>
